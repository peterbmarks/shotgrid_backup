# shotgrid backup
Script to download all assets from a shotgun cloud

Wrote this for some friends who have a large project in ShotGrid https://shotgridsoftware.com
It's easy to upload stuff but not easy to bulk download it.
This script uses the python API that you can find here: https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api

Works with Python2 or 3.
My friends used it on macOS with the built-in python2.
